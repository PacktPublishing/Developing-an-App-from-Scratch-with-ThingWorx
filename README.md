## About the Video Course
In this course, you will develop an end-to-end IOT security solution for safety and security along with the email and mobile app notification. The project uses Thingworx Platform for cloud communication. The project involves an intermediary level of coding for building end-to-end IoT security solution. You will be coding in Arduino IDE for building the IoT product. 

You will also learn to deal with connecting your edge device to the internet and eventually to the Thingworx Platform, a key element in the IOT solution. In the final section, we will connect everything together and build the IOT solution for Weather detection.
